# hestertzehun-project-2

## Overview

The second task, Project 2B, asks you to complete your implementation of the simulation de- scribed in the rest of this specification. You do not need to strictly adhere to the design you submitted for Project 2Aâ€”it is intended as a high-level design based only on reading the specifi- cation, and to practice designing using object-oriented principles before you begin programming. You will likely find ways to further improve the design as you implement it. Submission for Project 2B will be via Gitlab. You must make at least 5 commits throughout your project. This will be enforced.
